## 2024-05-24 - Add ARIA Labels to inline inputs
**Learning:** Inputs formatted as inline elements without explicit labels (like those added dynamically inside generic components or popups) need to have `aria-label` attributes set to communicate their purpose to screen readers. For example, the 'New Company' input fields in the ProtemoiBoard used `placeholder` text, which is an accessibility anti-pattern.
**Action:** When adding or discovering inline inputs without a corresponding `<label>` (especially if relying on placeholders for context), add a clear `aria-label` attribute describing the input's purpose.
## 2024-05-25 - Unlabeled Select Elements for View Filters
**Learning:** Native `<select>` elements acting as interactive toggles (like "View Mode" or "Filters") without explicit text `<label>` elements are invisible to screen readers, leaving users with no context on what the dropdown controls.
**Action:** When using `<select>` tags as inline filters or view switchers, always ensure they have an explicit `aria-label` attribute (e.g., `aria-label="Toggle view mode"`) to guarantee accessibility compliance.
## 2024-05-24 - Semantic Buttons for Complex Interactive Toggles
**Learning:** Using `div` with `role="button"` and manual `onKeyDown` handlers for complex interactive toggles (like the B.I.G. criteria accordion buttons) is an anti-pattern. Natively, screen readers and keyboard navigation correctly trigger standard `<button>` elements with `Space` and `Enter` implicitly without extra event listeners.
**Action:** Always refactor generic container elements mimicking buttons to `<button type="button">` and apply `w-full text-left block` for layout preservation.

## 2024-05-27 - Add Missing Base Button Class to Modifiers
**Learning:** When fixing UI components using DaisyUI, ensure all `btn-*` modifier classes (like `btn-ghost` or `btn-sm`) are preceded by the base `btn` class (e.g., `className="btn btn-ghost"`). Omitting `btn` causes missing base button styles, such as structural padding, proper height, and necessary touch targets.
**Action:** Always ensure `btn` is included alongside `btn-ghost` and other `btn-*` classes to maintain consistent and accessible touch targets.
