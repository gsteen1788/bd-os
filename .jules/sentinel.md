## 2024-05-22 - CSP Disabled by Default
**Vulnerability:** Content Security Policy (CSP) was explicitly set to `null` in `tauri.conf.json`.
**Learning:** Initial configurations or templates might disable CSP for development convenience, leaving the application vulnerable to XSS and data exfiltration.
**Prevention:** Always enforce a strict CSP in `tauri.conf.json`, using `'unsafe-inline'` only if strictly necessary and scoping `connect-src` to known endpoints.

## 2026-02-06 - Exposed Sensitive Data in Logs
**Vulnerability:** Full entity objects (Contact, Meeting Notes, Opportunities) containing PII and business-sensitive data were being logged to the console using `console.log`.
**Learning:** Developers often leave debug logs that dump entire objects, unaware that in production or shared environments, these logs can leak sensitive data.
**Prevention:** Use a logger that scrubs sensitive data or enforces a rule to only log IDs or safe summaries of entities. Review `console.log` usage during code reviews.
