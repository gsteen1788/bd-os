## 2024-05-22 - CSP Disabled by Default
**Vulnerability:** Content Security Policy (CSP) was explicitly set to `null` in `tauri.conf.json`.
**Learning:** Initial configurations or templates might disable CSP for development convenience, leaving the application vulnerable to XSS and data exfiltration.
**Prevention:** Always enforce a strict CSP in `tauri.conf.json`, using `'unsafe-inline'` only if strictly necessary and scoping `connect-src` to known endpoints.

## 2026-02-06 - Exposed Sensitive Data in Logs
**Vulnerability:** Full entity objects (Contact, Meeting Notes, Opportunities) containing PII and business-sensitive data were being logged to the console using `console.log`.
**Learning:** Developers often leave debug logs that dump entire objects, unaware that in production or shared environments, these logs can leak sensitive data.
**Prevention:** Use a logger that scrubs sensitive data or enforces a rule to only log IDs or safe summaries of entities. Review `console.log` usage during code reviews.

## 2026-03-03 - SQL Injection in Dynamic Query Construction
**Vulnerability:** A SQL injection vulnerability was found in `SqliteTaskRepository.populateLinks` where task IDs were directly interpolated into the SQL query string using `task_id IN (${taskIds})`.
**Learning:** Even when using typed IDs (like UUIDs), relying on string interpolation for dynamic lists (e.g., `IN` clauses) bypasses parameterization and creates injection risks.
**Prevention:** Always use parameterized queries (`$1`, `$2`, etc.) even for dynamic lists by generating the placeholders programmatically and passing the values array separately.

## 2026-02-10 - Prompt Injection in AI Services
**Vulnerability:** User inputs (e.g., meeting notes, next steps) were interpolated directly into the prompt string without sanitization or delimitation, allowing potential prompt injection attacks.
**Learning:** LLMs can be manipulated by malicious instructions embedded in input data if the prompt doesn't clearly distinguish between "instructions" and "data".
**Prevention:** Use XML-like tags (e.g., `<input>`) to wrap user data, sanitize the input to escape those tags, and explicitly instruct the model to treat the content within tags as data only.

## 2024-05-23 - Testing Vite-Dependent Security Logic
**Vulnerability:** Input sanitization logic was tightly coupled with Vite-specific environment variables (`import.meta.env`), making it impossible to verify with standalone Node.js scripts (`tsx`) without mocking the build environment.
**Learning:** Security-critical functions like input validation must be verifiable in isolation. Dependencies on build-time constants can hinder automated security testing.
**Prevention:** Extract pure security logic (sanitization, validation) into dedicated utility files (e.g., `security.ts`) that have zero dependencies on framework-specific globals, enabling easy unit testing with standard tools.
